							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Syllogia is building the next generation of AI systems for financial markets. We combine cutting-edge research in probabilistic machine learning, reinforcement learning, and reasoning systems with deep expertise in quantitative finance.</p>
							
							<h2>Our Approach</h2>
							<p>Traditional financial models often rely on simplified assumptions about market behavior. We take a different approach: building systems that can reason about uncertainty, learn from complex market dynamics, and adapt to changing conditions. Our research draws on advances in GFlowNets, Bayesian inference, and modern deep learning to create more robust and interpretable financial AI.</p>
							
							<h2>Research Focus</h2>
							<p>Our work spans several key areas at the intersection of AI and finance: uncertainty quantification in financial predictions, causal reasoning for market analysis, reinforcement learning for strategy development, and the integration of large language models with structured probabilistic reasoning. We believe the future of financial AI lies in systems that don't just recognize patterns, but can reason about them.</p>
							
							<h2>Get Involved</h2>
							<p>We're always interested in connecting with researchers, practitioners, and institutions working on related problems. Whether you're interested in collaboration, partnership opportunities, or just want to discuss our research, feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:info@syllogia.ai">info@syllogia.ai</a>.</p>
